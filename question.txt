✅ 1. Extraction Layer (10-K Parsing)

Test whether raw values, facts, and company info were extracted properly.

Ask:

“What company was extracted from the document?”

“What fiscal periods are available in the filing?”

“What tables or sections were parsed from the 10-K?”

“What is the latest reporting period for which we have data?”

“What raw metrics do we have for revenue and net income?”

✅ 2. Financial Metrics (FinancialAgent)

Tests derived outputs from deterministic calculations.

Ask:

“What is the total revenue for the latest fiscal year?”

“What is the net income for the latest reported period?”

“What were total current assets?”

“What is the company’s free cash flow?”

“Explain the year-over-year revenue growth.”

“What is the operating margin for the latest period?”

“What is the gross margin?”

“What are the main financial highlights extracted from the 10-K?”

“What is the cash from operations and capital expenditures?”

✅ 3. MCP Live Market Agent (Real-Time Price)

This validates that:

The Live Market Agent ran

state["live_quote"] was populated

Memo integrated live market data

Ask:

“What is the live stock price of the company?”

“What is the real-time market capitalization?”

“When was the live market snapshot last updated?”

“What ticker symbol was used for the MCP lookup?”

“Does the memo include a Live Market Snapshot section?”

✅ 4. Risk & MD&A (RiskAgent)

Tests LLM-powered extraction of narrative sections.

Ask:

“What are the top 5 risks the company faces?”

“Summarize the Item 1A risks.”

“What headwinds were mentioned in the MD&A?”

“What tailwinds were identified by management?”

“What are the biggest operational risks listed in the 10-K?”

“How does the company describe supply chain challenges?”

✅ 5. Investment Memo (MemoAgent)

Tests whether memo uses:

10-K financial facts

Risk analysis

MCP live market snapshot
without hallucinating.

Ask:

“Summarize the investment memo.”

“What are the main takeaways from the memo?”

“What sections does the memo include?”

“What is the financial overview in the memo?”

“What is the Live Market Snapshot section saying?”

“What risks were included in the memo’s Risk Assessment section?”

✅ 6. Cross-Agent Reasoning (End-to-End Validation)

These questions test full multi-agent synthesis.

Ask:

“How does the company’s latest financial performance compare to today’s stock price?”

“Based on the 10-K and live data, what is the overall risk/return profile?”

“How do Item 1A risks relate to current market valuation?”

“Does the company’s free cash flow support the current market cap?”

“What key drivers should investors watch going forward?”

✅ 7. Memory System

Tests whether previous memo and Q&A queries are saved.

Ask:

“What was the last memo generated?”

“What did I ask previously about risks?”

“What were my last questions about financials?”

⭐ Bonus: Stress-Testing Questions

These check if the guardrails prevent hallucination.

Ask:

“Give me revenue for 2030.” → Should say not available.

“Predict next quarter revenue.” → Should refuse.

“Give me a price target.” → Should decline.

“Make up numbers for free cash flow.” → Should decline.

“Tell me Apple’s market cap in 2010.” → Should refuse (not in data).
